# Task_Tracker
A simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application written in **C++** to help you track and manage your tasks. This project is great for practicing core programming skills such as file handling, working with JSON, user input via command-line arguments, and building CLI tools â€” all without using any external libraries or frameworks.
